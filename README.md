# Week7-TrainSchedule - Created a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. App will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js and will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.
When adding trains, user will submit the following:
Train Name
Destination
First Train Time -- in military time
Frequency -- in minutes
App will calculate when the next train will arrive, relative to the current time.
